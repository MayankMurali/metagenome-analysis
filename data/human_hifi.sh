SRX11580194: HiFi sequencing of pooled human gut microbiome standard: vegan diet
1 PACBIO_SMRT (Sequel II) run: 1.9M spots, 18.8G bases, 9.6Gb downloads

Design: High molecular weight DNA was extracted using the Qiagen PowerSoil Pro kit. Size selection was performed using 3.7X Diluted AMPure. Library prep was performed using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 and Enzyme Clean Up Kit 2.0. Each sample was sequenced on one SMRT Cell 8M on the Sequel IIe System with Sequel II Binding Kit 2.2 chemistry 2.0, with a 30hr movie time with a 2 hr pre-extension. HiFi reads (>Q20, >99% accurate CCS reads) were generated using CCS v6.0.0 in SMRT Link v10.1.
