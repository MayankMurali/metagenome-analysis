SRX9569057: Zymo D6331 PacBio Standard Input Library
1 PACBIO_SMRT (Sequel II) run: 2M spots, 18G bases, 9.9Gb downloads

Design: Standard Input: DNA was extracted using the Shoreline Breaker Kit. A total of 800 ng of starting DNA was used to perform the PacBio "Preparing HiFi Libraries from Low DNA Input Using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0" protocol (https://www.pacb.com/support/documentation/). DNA shearing was performed with a Megaruptor 3, sheared at speed 31. Typical steps were performed (remove single-strand overhangs, DNA damage repair, SMRTbell adapter ligation). Size selection was performed using 3.7X Diluted AMPure. The resulting library was sequenced on a SMRT Cell 8M on the Sequel II System, with a 30 hr movie. The subreads were used to generate HiFi (CCS) reads using a minimum 99% accuracy cutoff.
